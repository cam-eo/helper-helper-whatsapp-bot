#step 1: get first message from owner *store owner phone numer
#step 2: get name of owner *store owners name
#step 3: Send instructions on how to send us tasks
#step 4: recieve tasks and populate tasks list

HELPER
#step 3: send link to the helper
#step 3.1: *store helper phone number
#step 3.2: get helpers name *store name


#every day you are generating a list of tasks

    e.g. we recieve 1

    Update the message with task 1 stroked out

    Option2: replace the task with none and create new list of tasks complete

    resend Message
